# Capstone-Demo

Currently requires the pub_good_ztf_smallbodies.db sqlite file, placed in the same directory as the two .py files

Both can take a minute to start running, but once the server is running and assets are generated, the PyPlot based server loads nearly instantanously

To run:
    python app.py
        Will run the Plotly based server
    python test.py
        Will run the PyPlot based server
